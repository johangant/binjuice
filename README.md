# Summary

A really small tool to scrape a local authority waste collection page, convert the markup to markdown and distrubute with a webhook for further processing or distribution.

Scheduler using Circle CI, because Zapier's equivalent and code task is way too fussy and restrictive.

# License

MIT, because why not.
